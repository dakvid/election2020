<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>These dumbbell plots show the percent of the party vote received in each electorate, highlighting the shift from 2017, with the the caveat that there were boundary changes to around half of the electorates. Darker grey dots had the same boundaries and lighter grey have had changes.</p>
<p>As the headlines have been shouting, Labour had universal increases and National had universal decreases. ACT too had universal increases (though it would have been hard to have gone down).</p>
<p>The Greens had big increases in their strongholds and modest increases in most other places. I think the couple of notable decreases are due to boundary changes.</p>
<p>The Māori Party overall went down, which is unsurprising after three years out of parliament. It is interesting to see that the Māori electorates saw both jumps and drops - notably with less support in Waiariki, which was their only candidate win.</p>
<p>NZ First universally plummeted, being portrayed as Jacinda’s “hand brake”. TOP couldn’t make as much of a splash as they did last time, with drops across the board.</p>
<p>Would the cannabis referendum enthuse or dampen support for the Legalise Cannabis Party? They did indeed see a boost, most strikingly across the Māori electorates.</p>
<p>Finally, how did the vote share change between “the Left” (Labour, Green and Māori) vs “the Right” (National, ACT, Conservative and New Conservative)? The nationwide shift left <a href="https://david.frigge.nz/election2017/dumbbells.html#left-vs-right">begun in 2017</a> continues, with only three electorates remaining with a right-wing majority, and a further eight with a right-wing plurality.</p>
