This is the code and data for https://david.frigge.nz/election2020/

Comments and questions welcome, by email, GitHub issue or tweet.

The site is created in R, with help from notable packages such as:

* [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) for website design
* [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for interactive maps
* [plotly](http://plot.ly/r/) for interactive plots
* [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) for GIS functionality
* and of course most of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) for data munging

Mostly this is just an adaptation of https://github.com/dakvid/election2017/ -
more acknowledgements can be found there.
